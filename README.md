# Code Quiz

## Description

The Code Quiz is meant to be a simple in-browser application that asks javaScript trivia questions with multiple-choice answers, gives the user a score (based on both factual accuracy and the time it takes them to answer), and keeps track of a high-score list.

As yet, it is far from complete!
